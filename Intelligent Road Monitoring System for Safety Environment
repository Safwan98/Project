One of the major problems faced by developing countries is the 
maintenance of the road condition. The sensor- based Pothole Detection 
System uses ultrasonic Sensors for detecting those potholes more 
accurately than before and GPS is used for plotting the location of potholes 
on the map, it will give an alert to the driver about potholes using the 
buzzer.
Here, we propose the design of "Pothole detection System" which assists 
the driver in avoiding pot-holes on the roads, by giving prior warnings. 
Warnings can be like buzzer if its before to alert the driver. This system 
uses an ultrasonic sensor to sense the potholes before passing through 
it. This project aims to produce a Pothole Detection and Alert System. 
The main components of the project are the Accelerometer sensor, 
Ultrasonic Sensor, GPS and Arduino Uno.
